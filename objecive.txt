Title: Multi-Target Computational Profiling of Thymoquinone: Docking, EEG Simulation, and Reward-Learning Predictions

Background:
CNS disorders arise from multi-receptor dysfunction (dopaminergic, glutamatergic, monoaminergic). Thymoquinone shows reported neuroprotective effects; however, its multi-target CNS profile and systems-level neural implications remain unexplored.

Objectives:
Quantify thymoquinone binding across DRD2, MAO-B, and NMDA receptors vs clinically validated ligands.
Derive ligand efficiency and selectivity profiles.
Simulate EEG spectral changes from receptor modulation.
Map binding to reinforcement-learning (RPE) parameters predicting behavior.

Methods:
Structure-based docking via AutoDock Vina.
Python pipelines automate affinity, ligand efficiency, selectivity, and statistical comparisons (Kruskal–Wallis + Mann–Whitney U).
Binding → EEG spectral simulation (beta, gamma, alpha bands).
DRD2/NMDA binding → TD reinforcement learning model for reward prediction.
Visual validation in PyMOL.

Expected Outcomes:
Identify polypharmacology and target bias.
Generate testable EEG & behavioral hypotheses.
Establish workflow connecting molecular pharmacology → neural dynamics → computational behavior modeling.

NeuroData Relevance:
Integrates computational pharmacology, EEG simulation, and RL-based cognitive modeling — fully aligned with neuroinformatics and brain-signal analysis goals.
